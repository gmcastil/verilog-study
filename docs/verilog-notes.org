** Clause 1 - Overview
Standard Delay Format (SDF) constructs
Programming Language Interface (PLI) binding mechanism
Backus Naur form
1. Lowercase words denote syntactic categories
2. Boldface for keywords, operators and punctuation marks as a required part of
   the syntax.
3. Vertical bar separates alternative items unless bolded.
4. Square brackets enclose optional items.
5. Braces enclose a repeated item
** Clause 2 - Lexical conventions
A point of clarification.  The Verilog language definition is described using
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%25E2%2580%2593Naur_form][Backus Naur form]] and makes use of metasymbols such as "::=".  This can be
interpreted as "is defined as".  The "|" is used separated alternative
definitions and is interpreted as "or".  The names enclosed in <,> are
delimiters enclosing a class name.

*** Numbers
Couple things to note here:
1. The question mark (?) is a Verilog HDL alternative for the ~z~ character.  It
   sets 4 bits to the high-impedance value in hex, 3 bits in octal, and 1 bit in
   binary.  So for example, 12'hz would be a 12-bit high-impedance value.
2. If the value is to be interpreted as signed, an ~s~ character precedes it.
   So, 4'shf denotes the 4-bit number 1111 to be interpreted as a 2's complement
   number.
3. Automatic left padding is supported by the language.  So there is nothing
   ambiguous about things like 32'b0 or 16'hz, which create a 32-bit zero number
   and a 16-bit high-impedance number, respectively.
4. The number of bits used to make up an unsized number (which is a simple
   decimal number or a number without the size specification) shall be at least
   32 bits.  So watch out when doing things like foo_reg = 0.
5. Real numbers are double precision floating point values as defined by
   IEEE-754.
6. Conversion of reals to integers is done via rounding to the nearest integer,
   rather than by truncating it.  Conversion occurs implicitly when a real
   number is assigned to an integer

*** Strings
Things to note:
1. I have no idea what strings mean in the context of design, probably in
   verification though
2. Strings are valid operands in expressions and assignments - they get treated
   as unsigned integer constants represented by a sequence of 8-bit ASCII values
   with one 8-bit ASCII value representing one character.
3. Operations with strings work the same way as they do with values - if the LHS
   is longer than the string on the RHS, it is extended with zeros.  If the RHS
   is longer, then the leftmost bits are truncated and lost.
4. Some characters can only be used when they are escaped (e.g., carriage
   returns, backslash).

*** Identifiers, keywords, and directives
- List of all keywords in Annex B
- The $ character introduces a language construct that enables development of
  user-defined tasks and functions.  These are not design semantics, but refer
  to simulator functionality.  These are described in Clause 17.
- Compiler directives are introduced by a backtick (`).  These are described in
  Clause 19.
- Standard defines a way to specify properties about objects, statements, and
  groups of statements in Verilog source.  These are referred to as *attributes*
  and the standarde defines how to specify them, but not on what they mean.  An
  example is the full_case, parallel_case attribute
#+BEGIN_SRC  verilog
(* full_case, parallel_case *)
case (foo)
  <rest_of_case_statement>
endcase
#+END_SRC
- Attributes can also be used in less familiar ways like attaching attributes to
  an operator or to a Verilog function.  There are several pages of tables
  describing the syntax of attributes when used with operators, functions,
  modules, and the rest of the language.
** Clause 3 - Data types
- Familiar four basic values are 0, 1, x, and z.
- In addition to values, /strength/ can also be added.

*** Nets and variables

**** Nets
- Represent physical connections between structural entities such as gates
- Cannot store a value - rely on the value of its drivers such as a continuous
  assignment or gate (clauses 16 and 17).
